  <p>In Malaysia, the ICU usage has reached <span style="color:orangered;font-size:28px" >84%</span>, hospitals in seven of Malaysia's 13 states reported that more than <span style="color:orangered;font-size:28px" >90%</span> of their ICU beds were being utilised for Covid-19 patients.</p>

<h1>Factors contribute to Deaths</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: bolder;">17,456,515 individuals</span> were included. 17,063 died from COVID-19 and <span style="font-weight: bolder;">134,316 from other causes.</span>Most factors associated with COVID-19 death were similarly associated with non-COVID death, but the magnitudes of association differed. Similar associations of most individual-level factors with COVID-19 and non-COVID death suggest that COVID-19 largely multiplies existing risks faced by patients.</p>
<p>Below are the relationships among few important criteria to determine the deaths of COVID-19 in a country.</p>

<h1> COVID-19 Cases of the World</h1>
<p>The June 2020 Global Economic Prospects describes both the immediate and near-term outlook for the <span style="font-weight: bolder;font-size: 18px;">impact of the pandemic</span> and the long-term damage it has dealt to prospects for growth. The baseline forecast envisions a <span style="font-weight: bolder; font-size: 18px;">5.2 percent contraction in global GDP</span> in 2020, using market exchange rate weights—the deepest global recession in decades, despite the extraordinary efforts of governments to counter the downturn with fiscal and monetary policy support. </p>
